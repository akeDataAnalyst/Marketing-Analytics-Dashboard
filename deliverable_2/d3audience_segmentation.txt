Deliverable 3: Audience Segmentation
For this task, we will use RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. This is a powerful marketing technique that segments customers based on their transactional behavior.

Recency (R): How recently a customer made a purchase or engaged with the app. More recent customers are more likely to respond to a promotion.

Frequency (F): How often a customer interacts with the app or makes a purchase. Frequent customers are more engaged and loyal.

Monetary (M): How much money a customer has spent. High-spending customers are our most valuable.
