Deliverable 2: Campaign Performance & ROI (SQL & Visualization)

Task: Evaluate the effectiveness of different ad campaigns.

What we'll do: Join the users and campaigns tables to calculate the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) for each campaign (total_cost / number_of_users_acquired). We'll also calculate Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) by looking at revenue generated from each campaign (we can simulate this based on user actions).

Output: A Tableau or Power BI dashboard with visualizations of CAC and ROAS by campaign.

Our goal is to use SQL to calculate two key metrics for each of our paid campaigns: Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) measures how much it costs to acquire one new user through a specific campaign.
CAC=
fracTotalCampaignCostNumberofUsersAcquired

Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) measures the revenue generated for every dollar spent on a campaign.
ROAS=
fracTotalRevenuefromCampaignTotalCampaignCost
